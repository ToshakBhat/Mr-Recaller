<H3>Problem statement 📝 </H3>
<p>Students face problems in remembering facts which is due to a lack  
Lack of right resources and accommodations.
Research finds that on average a student forgets about 40% of what he learnt in school and remembers only 37%.</p>

<H3>Solution 👨‍💻 </H3>
<p>The idea is to develop a Conversational Bot that leverages the principles of <b>Active Recall</b> to facilitate learning. The bot will engage users in interactive conversations (it will be through speech, no need to write anything), asking them to explain concepts they've learned and then our bot will ask simple follow-up questions to reinforce comprehension. 
The follow-up questions are not to test the user for the understanding of text but to comprehend whatever they read is cleared to them or not.

<h4>Types of learning</h4>
1. Rote learning – not comprehensive, No relationship between old and new information.
2. Active learning – comprehensive relationship between past and present information
3. Passive learning – not comprehensive, also known as learning by osmosis because it is based on the body passively receiving knowledge through its senses.</p>

Active learning helps students reflect on their understanding by encouraging them to make connections between their prior knowledge and new concepts .
Or we can say that it is a learning technique used by experts to stimulate the memory of learners during the learning process on things they’ve learned. Because learning is more than just content consumption,
it’s about deepening your understanding of the information.

<h2>The main principle behind this idea is a different approach to learning as suppose the users are teachers themselves. If they teaches the concepts to someone that means they really understand it .</h2>
